## What is zygoat?

`zygoat` is a command line tool used to bootstrap and configure a React/Django/Postgres stack web application.

Linting, test configuration, boilerplate, and development environment are automatically taken care of using `zygoat` so that you can get up and running faster.

`zygoat` also includes a preset deployment configuration to allow you to deploy your stack to an AWS environment with a single command. You'll get a full serverless AWS stack to keep things inexpensive and nimble.

## How do I use it?

We'll get to that when we get to it. Right now, it's under active development, so check back frequently!

`zygoat` is developed using the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) packaging framework for Python projects to make development as simple and portable as possible.
